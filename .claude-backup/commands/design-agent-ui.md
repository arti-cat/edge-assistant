# Design Agent Orchestration UI

Plan and design a web-based frontend interface for the multi-agent orchestration system.

## Instructions

1. **UI Architecture Planning**
   - Design component hierarchy for agent management interface
   - Plan real-time agent status and communication display
   - Create workflow for project selection and context setting
   - Design agent configuration and customization interface

2. **Core Interface Components**
   - Agent dashboard with status indicators and progress tracking
   - Project browser with file tree and context management
   - Task input interface with natural language processing
   - Results viewer with diff previews and code highlighting

3. **Agent Interaction Design**
   - Visual representation of agent orchestration flows
   - Real-time chat interface for agent communications
   - Agent selection and configuration panels
   - Progress tracking with parallel agent execution visualization

4. **Integration Planning**
   - REST API design for backend communication
   - WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
   - File system integration for project management
   - Authentication and session management

5. **Technology Stack Selection**
   - Choose appropriate frontend framework (React/Vue/Svelte)
   - Plan backend API structure (FastAPI/Flask integration)
   - Design database schema for session and project management
   - Select real-time communication approach (WebSocket/SSE)

6. **User Experience Features**
   - Drag-and-drop project loading
   - Tabbed interface for multiple concurrent tasks
   - Code editor integration with syntax highlighting
   - Export capabilities for agent outputs and workflows

7. **Development Roadmap**
   - Phase 1: Basic agent execution interface
   - Phase 2: Real-time orchestration visualization  
   - Phase 3: Advanced project management features
   - Phase 4: Collaborative features and sharing
