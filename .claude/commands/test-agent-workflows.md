# Test Agent Workflows

Comprehensive testing strategy for the multi-agent orchestration system across different development scenarios.

## Instructions

1. **Unit Testing for Individual Agents**
   - Test each specialist agent in isolation
   - Validate tool registration and function calling
   - Test agent response parsing and error handling
   - Verify agent state management and persistence

2. **Integration Testing for Orchestration**
   - Test agent-as-tool integration patterns
   - Validate parallel agent execution
   - Test result synthesis and coordination
   - Verify orchestrator decision-making logic

3. **End-to-End Workflow Testing**
   - Test complete development workflows from CLI
   - Validate multi-step agent interactions
   - Test error recovery and graceful degradation
   - Verify safety mechanisms and diff previews

4. **Performance and Load Testing**
   - Test orchestration performance with multiple agents
   - Validate timeout handling and resource management
   - Test concurrent agent execution efficiency
   - Monitor API usage and rate limiting

5. **Real-World Scenario Testing**
   - Test with various project types (Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.)
   - Validate agent behavior on large codebases
   - Test complex development tasks requiring multiple agents
   - Verify agent recommendations and code quality

6. **User Experience Testing**
   - Test CLI interface usability and clarity
   - Validate error messages and user guidance
   - Test session management and conversation continuity
   - Verify backward compatibility with existing features

7. **Security and Safety Testing**
   - Test file access controls and permissions
   - Validate diff preview and backup mechanisms
   - Test API key handling and secure communications
   - Verify agent output sanitization and validation
