# Create Development Agents

Implement the four specialized development agents for the edge-assistant orchestration system.

## Instructions

1. **Project Analysis Agent**
   - Create agent that analyzes codebase structure and architecture
   - Implement tools for dependency analysis and pattern detection  
   - Add framework/language detection capabilities
   - Generate comprehensive project summaries and recommendations

2. **Code Generation Agent**
   - Build agent focused on creating code following project patterns
   - Implement pattern extraction from existing codebase
   - Add boilerplate generation with project-specific conventions
   - Create feature implementation workflows

3. **Testing Agent**
   - Develop agent specialized in test creation and analysis
   - Add test coverage analysis tools
   - Implement test pattern detection for different frameworks
   - Create comprehensive test suite generation

4. **Documentation Agent**
   - Build agent for generating and maintaining documentation
   - Implement code comment analysis and generation
   - Add API documentation extraction from code
   - Create README and technical specification generation

5. **Agent Integration and Orchestration**
   - Create agent-as-tool wrapper functions for each specialist
   - Implement parallel execution capabilities  
   - Add result synthesis and coordination logic
   - Test multi-agent workflows with real development tasks

6. **Quality Assurance**
   - Validate each agent works independently
   - Test orchestrated workflows with multiple agents
   - Ensure proper error handling and graceful degradation
   - Verify integration with existing safety mechanisms
