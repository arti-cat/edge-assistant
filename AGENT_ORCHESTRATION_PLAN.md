# Agent Orchestration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to integrate multi-agent orchestration capabilities into `edge-assistant`, creating a development assistance system that uses specialized AI agents to help with software engineering tasks.

## Background & Inspiration

Based on OpenAI's agent orchestration patterns, particularly:
- **Agent-as-Tool Pattern**: Central orchestrator delegates to specialist agents
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously 
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on specific domain knowledge
- **Safe Operations**: All changes preview diffs before applying

## Current Architecture Strengths

The existing `edge-assistant` codebase provides excellent foundations:

1. **Engine Class**: OpenAI API wrapper with lazy initialization
2. **Tool System**: Function tools infrastructure ready for extension
3. **State Management**: XDG-compliant persistence for sessions
4. **CLI Structure**: Typer-based commands easily extensible
5. **Safety Model**: Diff preview and backup system for file operations
6. **Knowledge Base**: Existing file indexing and search capabilities

## Integration Strategy

**Extend, don't rebuild** - Build on proven architecture:

### Engine Extensions
```python
# New methods in engine.py
class Engine:
    def create_agent(self, name, instructions, tools=None, model=None):
        """Create a reusable agent configuration"""
    
    def orchestrate(self, orchestrator_agent, specialist_agents, task):
        """Run agent-as-tool orchestration pattern"""
```

### New Agent Module Structure
```
edge_assistant/
├── agents/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base.py          # Agent base classes & orchestration
│   ├── dev_agents.py    # Specialized development agents
│   └── tools.py         # Agent-specific tools
```

### Enhanced CLI Integration
```python
# Extend existing cli.py
@app.command("dev")
def dev_assist(
    task: str,
    project: Path = typer.Option("."),
    agents: str = typer.Option("all"),
    model: str = typer.Option("gpt-4o")
):
    """Multi-agent development assistance"""
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Agent Framework
**Goal**: Establish foundation for agent orchestration

**Tasks**:
1. Create base agent classes using OpenAI agent patterns
2. Extend Engine class with agent orchestration methods
3. Add agent state management to existing state.py
4. Create development-focused tool definitions
5. Implement agent-as-tool orchestration pattern

**Deliverables**:
- `edge_assistant/agents/base.py` - Agent base classes
- Enhanced `engine.py` with orchestration methods
- Extended `state.py` for agent session tracking
- Basic development tools (file analysis, project structure)

### Phase 2: Specialized Development Agents
**Goal**: Create domain-specific agents for development tasks

**Agents to Implement**:

1. **Project Analysis Agent**
   - Analyze codebase structure and architecture
   - Identify patterns, frameworks, and conventions
   - Generate project summaries and documentation

2. **Code Generation Agent**
   - Create boilerplate code following project patterns
   - Implement features based on specifications
   - Maintain consistency with existing codebase

3. **Testing Agent**
   - Generate unit and integration tests
   - Analyze code coverage gaps
   - Create test fixtures and mocks

4. **Documentation Agent**
   - Generate API documentation from code
   - Create README files and code comments
   - Write technical specifications

**Deliverables**:
- `edge_assistant/agents/dev_agents.py` - Specialized agent implementations
- Enhanced tool set for development tasks
- Agent coordination workflows

### Phase 3: CLI Integration & Polish
**Goal**: Seamless user experience and production readiness

**Tasks**:
1. Add `dev` command with full orchestration
2. Integrate with existing KB system for project context
3. Enhanced safety with multi-file change previews
4. Session management for development workflows
5. Error handling and graceful degradation

**Deliverables**:
- Complete CLI integration
- Documentation and examples
- Test coverage for agent functionality
- Performance optimization

## Key Design Decisions

### Agent-as-Tool Pattern
- **Main orchestrator** coordinates all activities
- **Specialist agents** called as tools for specific tasks
- **Single thread of control** maintains transparency
- **Parallel execution** where appropriate for performance

### Leverage Existing Infrastructure
- **Reuse Engine class** - extend rather than replace
- **Build on existing tools** - extend fs_write, add analysis tools
- **Integrate KB system** - use indexed files for project context
- **Preserve safety model** - all changes show diffs first

### Development-Focused Specialization
Agents optimized for real development workflows:
- **Architecture analysis**: Understanding complex codebases
- **Feature implementation**: Following project patterns
- **Test generation**: Comprehensive coverage strategies
- **Code review**: Improvement suggestions and best practices

## Example Usage Scenarios

```bash
# Analyze new project
edge-assistant dev "analyze this Django project and explain the architecture"

# Generate feature with tests  
edge-assistant dev "add user authentication with tests" --project ./myapp

# Code review workflow
edge-assistant dev "review changes in git diff and suggest improvements"

# Documentation generation
edge-assistant dev "create API documentation for all endpoints"

# Multi-step development task
edge-assistant dev "add Redis caching to the user service, update tests, and document the changes"
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Orchestration Flow
1. **Task Analysis**: Orchestrator analyzes user request
2. **Agent Selection**: Determines which specialist agents to invoke
3. **Parallel Execution**: Runs independent analyses simultaneously
4. **Result Synthesis**: Combines specialist outputs
5. **Action Planning**: Creates concrete implementation steps
6. **Safety Preview**: Shows all file changes as diffs
7. **Execution**: Applies changes with user approval

### State Management
Extend existing state.py:
```python
def get_agent_session(name: str) -> Optional[Dict]
def set_agent_session(name: str, data: Dict) -> None  
def get_project_context(path: Path) -> Dict
def set_project_context(path: Path, context: Dict) -> None
```

### Tool Extensions
New development-focused tools:
- `analyze_project_structure()` - Understand codebase layout
- `extract_patterns()` - Identify coding conventions
- `generate_tests()` - Create test files
- `update_documentation()` - Modify docs and comments
- `preview_changes()` - Multi-file diff preview

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: Builds on proven, existing architecture
2. **Incremental Adoption**: Add agents gradually without breaking changes
3. **Safety First**: Inherits diff-preview and backup systems
4. **Context Aware**: Leverages existing KB indexing
5. **Familiar UX**: Same CLI patterns users already know
6. **Extensible**: Easy to add new agents and capabilities
7. **Production Ready**: Inherits existing error handling and state management

## Success Metrics

2. **Implement project analysis agent** as proof of concept
3. **Add basic orchestration** to existing CLI
4. **Iterate based on usage** and feedback
